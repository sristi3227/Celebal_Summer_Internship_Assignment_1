## 🗂️ Code Location

All React source code files (components, styles, entry points) are located inside the `src/` directory:

- `src/Components/` → Contains `Form.jsx` and `SuccessPage.jsx`
- `src/App.jsx` and `main.jsx` → Setup routing and render the app
- `src/App.css`, `index.css` → Custom styling
